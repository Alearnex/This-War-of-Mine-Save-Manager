This program has been written in c++.
When you open it the first time it will ask you to insert the path where your game saves the data.
Search for this kind of path: TWoM Folder\Profile\your profile\Saves otherwise click with dx mouse 
button on the game icon and open file location and then look for the Profile\your profile\Saves. 
Once you have the path paste it into the program and press enter, the program is capital sensitive 
so be aware that the path is exactly the same of the one you typed in. 
The program will then create a configuration file and 5 directories for the slots don't delte or move
any of those file and neither the .exe file. If you want to change the location of the program just
create a shotcut. Be aware the program might not work with all the version of the game and i am not 
responable for any damage or malfunctioning of your machine.
You can use the code for personal and educational purpouse only.
